## Authentication library for Codeigniter 3

This is a basic authentication library. Which is limited to login, logout and lostpassword. It does not include roles or acl (access control list) other than is user logged in.

See our other library for advanced access control

Also note that this library does not cover user profile. You should create a separate controller and crud as this will normally be different from site to site.
